    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Atter application is a solution intended to ease the organization of academic activities for both the
      organizers
      and the attendees, providing an easy to use system, for tracking not only the attendances, but also the attendees
      progress
      troughout the activity and the oraganizers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is built in a way where all the data is provided in real-time, making the attendance tracking
      more
      interactive. We also provide statistics for grades, attendance and possible attendance frauds.
      The impelemtation of our tracking system involves using the geolocation of an users device (with his approval).
      By
      doing so, we are able to detect possible frauds and guarantee easy and fast check-ins. We feel that this approach
      is the best, not only for an organizer that wants to have accurate statistics about his activity, but also for
      the attendee
      that wants to check in trough only one key press.

      <h3>Single-page application</h3>
      <p>
        Atter is made using its own Single-Page Appliation(SPA), built specifically to support its needs.
        We choose SPA over MPA(Multiple-Page Application) because SPA is fast, more interactive and can provide
        a more pleasant experience towards its user. It is also easier to develop a serverless application using SPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are following a traditional way of implementing a SPA, but we did some enhancements introducing built-in
        Dependency Injection system, Component life-cycle Hooks, Style Encapsulation for each component, a DOM renderer
        that makes sure only the differences between what is already rendered and what should be rendered will be
        processed, improving the DOM rendering performance and a template engine that lets us interpolate HTML with JS,
        greatly reducing the development time and increasing the code readability and reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our SPA framework has the following components:
        <ul>
          <li>Application container</li>
          <li>Route manager</li>
          <li>Router</li>
          <li>Component mananger</li>
          <li>Renderer</li>
          <li>Renderable element equivalent to components from known SPA frameworks</li>
          <li>Dependency Injection container</li>
          <li>DOM processors, used to manipulate events like click, submit on an element from a renderable, etc</li>
          <li>Encapsulator, used to encapsulate styles for renderables</li>
          <li>Life-cycles hooks: AfterRender, OnInit, OnRefresh and OnDestroy</li>
          <li>Template engine</li>
          <li></li>

      <h3>Serverless application</h3>
      <p>
        We chose to build a serverless application with the help of firebase. It has multiple advantages and we are
        going to discuss a few of them.
        Building a serverless application with the help of Firebase means a couple of things: we do not have to worry
        about
        different operating systems, the "backend" becomes safer and secure and it reduces the total cost of
        ownership.
        Of course there could be some disadvantages to this approach as we have no idea about what is going on in the
        server at most times.
        <p>Firebase also provides us with a real-time database, which is strongly recommended for our attendance
          aplication.

    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      Atter uses a set of technologies and programming paradigms like TypeScript, RxJs, Firebase, HTML5, CSS and
      NodeJS. We have explained the benefits of Firebase previously so in the following chapters we will explain the benefits
      of other technologies.
    </p>
    <section id="Typescript">
      <h3>Why TypeScript instead of JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>
        We chose TypeScript over JavaScript for multiple reasons but the most important one is that TypeScript provides
        an optional type system for JavaScript.
        Types, in our opinion, increase code readability and lower human error for the simple reason that the
        compiler catches errors instead of the user at runtime. Further more, types are the best form of documentation
        that a developer has at its disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and beacuse of that, JavaScript works the same in
        TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our application relies heavily on the decorators that TypeScript brings, in order to collect metadata and
        set-up behaviors.
        We think that is the best approach to this problem that we would have encountered if we would be using JavaScript.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="RxJs">
      <h3>Functional reactive programming with RxJs</h3>
      <p>
        RxJs solves the problem of asynchronous operations, but Promises also solve the problem and are built-in JavaScript.
        Then why are we using RxJs?
      </p>
      <p>
        We are storing our data into a Real-time database from Firebase. Firebase uses an event source approach in order
        to retrieve data,
        so when something is changing into a collection we have to react to that modification accordingly and using
        Promises would not
        solve the problem of dealing with more than one event.They would complicate things and the code would be hard
        to understand and mantain.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="HTMLANDCSS">
      <h3>HTML5 and CSS3</h3>
      <p>
        Using the features of HTML5 and CSS3 lets us complete multiple tasks with relative ease. Our application is fully responsive
        trough media queries, grid and flex, while HTML5 offers us the best tools for a rich multimedia experience and well organised code.
      </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <section id="SolvinFalseAttendance">
      <h3>Solving the problem of false attendance</h3>
      <p>
        In order for our application to be complete, we need to make sure it is pretty hard to fake an attendance. For this purpose we are going to use to our aid, most
        likely, the geolocation. This way we are going to set a perimeter around the organizer of an event and allow check in a chosen radius of metters.
        An alternative to this, is the use of an QR Code generated by the organizer each time he wants to perform a check-in.

  <section typeof="sa:ExternalApis" id="ExternalApis" role="ExternalApis">
    <h3>ExternalAPIs</h3>
      <p>
        Our application is limited when it comes to the use of external API's. The only thing we do need them for is importing data for the atendees.
        For this purpose we are going to use Google Drive and/or DropBox with a few formats available such as: JSON, XLS and maybe XML.
