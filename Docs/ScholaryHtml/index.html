    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Atter application is a solution intended to ease the organization of academic activities for both the organizers
      and the attendees, providing an easy to use system, for tracking not only the attendances, but also the attendees progress 
      troughout the activity and the oraganizers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is built in a way where all the data is provided in real-time, making the attendance tracking more
      interactive. We also provide statistics for grades, attendance and possible attendance frauds.
      The impelemtation of our tracking system involves using the geolocation of an users device (with his approval). By
      doing so, we are able to detect possible frauds and guarantee easy and fast check-ins. We feel that this approach 
      is the best, not only for an organizer that wants to have accurate statistics about his activity, but also for the attendee
      that wants to check in trough only one key press.

      <h3>Single-page application</h3>
      <p>
        Atter is made using its own Single-Page Appliation(SPA), built specifically to support its needs.
        We choose SPA over MPA(Multiple-Page Application) because SPA is fast, more interactive and can provide 
        a more pleasant experience towards its user. It is also easier to develop a serverless application using SPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are following a traditional way of implementing a SPA, but we did some enhancements introducing built-in
        Dependency Injection system, Component life-cycle Hooks, Style Encapsulation for each component, a DOM renderer
        that makes sure only the differences between what is already rendered and what should be rendered will be
        processed, improving the DOM rendering performance and a template engine that lets us interpolate HTML with JS, 
        greatly reducing the development time and increasing the code readability and reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our SPA framework has the following components:
        <ul>
          <li>Application container</li>
          <li>Route manager</li>
          <li>Router</li>
          <li>Component mananger</li>
          <li>Renderer</li>
          <li>Renderable element equivalent to components from known SPA frameworks</li>
          <li>Dependency Injection container</li>
          <li>DOM processors, used to manipulate events like click, submit on an element from a renderable, etc</li>
          <li>Encapsulator, used to encapsulate styles for renderables</li>
          <li>Life-cycles hooks: AfterRender, OnInit, OnRefresh and OnDestroy</li>
          <li>Template engine</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      Atter uses a set of technologies and programming paradigms like TypeScript, RxJs, Firebase, HTML5, CSS and
      NodeJS. We explain the benefits of Firebase previously but in the following chapters we will explain the benefits
      for the other ones.
    </p>
    <section id="Typescript">
      <h3>Why TypeScript instead of JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>
        We chose TypeScript over JavaScript for multiple reasons but the most important one is that TypeScript provides
        an optional type system for JavaScript.
        Types, in our opinion, increases the code readability and lower the human error for the simple reason that the
        compiler catches error instead of the user at runtime. Further more, types are the best form of documentation
        that a developer have to its disposal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and beacuse of that JavaScript works the same in TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our application relies heavily on the decorators that TypeScript brings, in order to collect metadata and set-up behaviors, 
        we think taht is the best approach to this problem that we would encounter if we were using JavaScript.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="RxJs">
      <h3>Functional reactive programming with RxJs</h3>
      <p>
        RxJs solve the problem of asynchronous operations, but Promises solve the same and are built-in JavaScript, then why using RxJs?
      </p>
      <p>
        We are storing our data into a Real-time database from Firebase. Firbase uses a event source approach in order to retrieve data, 
        so when something is changing into a collection we have to react to that modification accordingly and using Promises did not 
        solve the problem of dealing with more than one event, would complicate things and the code was hard to understand and maintain.
