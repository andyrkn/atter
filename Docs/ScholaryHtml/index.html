    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Atter application is a solution intended to ease the organizing academic activities and it's attendees,
      providing a easy to use system for tracking attendances for both consumers, oraganizer and attendee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is built in a way where all the data is provided in real-time making the attendance tracking more
      interactive. Also, we are able to provide statistics for attendance and possible frauds.
      The impelemtation for tracking an attendance uses the geolacation of the user device (with his approval), by
      doing so we are able to detect possible frauds. We feel that this approach is the best for an organizer that
      wants to have an accurate attendance statistics.

      <h3>Single-page application</h3>
      <p>
        Atter is made unsing its own Single-Page Appliation(SPA) built specifically to support its needs.
        We choose SPA over MPA(Multiple-Page Application) because SPA is fast, more interactive, can provie to the
        user a more pleasant experience, it's easier to develop a serverless application using SPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are following a traditional way of implementing a SPA but we did some enhancements introducing built-in
        Dependency Injection system, component life-cycle hooks, style encapsulation for each component, a DOM renderer
        that makes sure that only the differences between what is already rendered and what should be rendered will
        affect the DOM improving performance and a template engine that help us to interpolate HTML with JS making the
        imporving development time and code readability and reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our SPA framework has the following components:
        <ul>
          <li>Application container</li>
          <li>Router manager</li>
          <li>Component mananger</li>
          <li>Renderer</li>
          <li>Renderable element equivalent to components from known SPA frameworks</li>
          <li>Dependency Injection container</li>
          <li>DOM processors, used to manipulate events like click, submit on an element from a renderable etc</li>
          <li>Encapsulator, used to encapsulate style for renderables</li>
          <li>Life-cycles hooks: AfterRender, OnInit, OnRefresh and OnDestroy</li>
          <li>Template engine</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      Atter uses a set of technologies and programming paradigms like TypeScript, RxJs, Firebase, HTML5, CSS and
      NodeJS. We explain the benefits of Firebase previously but in the following chapters we will explain the benefits
      for the other ones.
